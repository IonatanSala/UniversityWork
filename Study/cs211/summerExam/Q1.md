### Compare the efficiency of binary trees to other data structures

The average search through a binary tree is O(logN), insertion is O(logN), deletion is O(logN) and traversing the tree is O(N). Linked lists are slower seacrch and deletion  with O(N), but faster insertion O(1).
Hash tables are overall better at everything compared to binary trees. Search, Insertion and Deletion is O(1) in hash tables.
